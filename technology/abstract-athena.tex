\section{Amazon Athena}
Amazon Athena~\cite{hid-sp18-521-athena-faq} allows you to analyze data
stored in Amazon S3 using SQL\@. It was created with the purpose of
allowing anyone with SQL skills to quickly analyze large datasets.
Athena will allow a user to run ad hoc SQL queries without the need to
load or aggregate the data outside of S3 and can process structured,
semi-structured and unstructured data sets. It it serverless so there
is no need to deal with the setup or managing of infrastructure. This
also allows Athena to scale automatically so the results continue to
be fast with large datasets and complex queries. Athena uses Presto
which is an open source SQL query engine which is optimized for low
latency ad hoc querying. You can access Athena in multiple ways
including the AWS Management Console, API or JDBC driver. It also
integrates into Amazon Quicksight allowing you to visualize the data
stored in your S3 environment based on your Athena queries. Athena is
ideal for quick ad hoc querying, but can also handle complex joins,
window functions and arrays. You only pay for the queries you run.
