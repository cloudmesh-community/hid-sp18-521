\section{Amazon EMR}

Amazon EMR~\cite{hid-sp18-521-AmazonEMR} is a managed Hadoop framework 
that allows you to process large amounts of data across dynamically 
scalable AWS EC2 instances. It allows the user to focus on the processing
of the data and not have to deal with the setup, management or tuning of 
a Hadoop cluster. Additionally, you can use Amazon EMR to run Apache 
Spark, HBase, Presto and Flink and also interact with other AWS data 
stores like S3 and DynamoDB. Using EMR allows a user to setup and provision 
a Hadoop cluster quickly and you can scale your compute resources up or 
down as needed. EMR is built to handle a large set of big data use cases 
including web indexing, ETL, data mining, log file analysis, machine 
learning, financial analysis, scientific simulation and bioinformatics 
research. You can interact with EMR through a web service interface that
allows you to build processing workflows and programatically monitor 
the progress of running clusters. Or you can also use the AWS Management 
Console to launch and monitor your clusters.
