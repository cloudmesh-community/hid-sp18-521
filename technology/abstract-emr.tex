\section{Amazon EMR}
Amazon EMR~\cite{hid-sp18-521-AmazonEMR} is a managed Hadoop framework 
that allows the user to process large amounts of data on the AWS platform using
their EC2 technology to spread the load across multiple EC2 instances. It allows
the user to focus on the processing of the data and not have to deal with the 
setup, management or tuning of a Hadoop cluster. Using EMR allows a user to setup
and provision a Hadoop cluster quickly and you can scale your compute resources up
or down as needed. You can interact with EMR through a web service interface that
allows you to build processing workflows and pragmatically monitor the progress of
running clusters. Or you can also use the AWS Management Console to launch and 
monitor your clusters.
