\section{Amazon EMR}
Amazon EMR~\cite{hid-sp18-521-AmazonEMR} is a Hadoop framework that allows
the user to process data on the AWS platform using their EC2 technology to
spread the load across multiple EC2 instances. The user can choose to run 
several other popular distributed frameworks on EMR in addition to Hadoop. 
It allows the user to focus on the processing of the data and not have to
deal with the setup, management or tuning of a Hadoop cluster. Using EMR
allows a user to setup and provision a Hadoop cluster quickly and you can
scale your compute resources up or down as needed. You can interact with
EMR through a web service interface or you can also use the AWS Management
Console to launch and monitor your clusters.
