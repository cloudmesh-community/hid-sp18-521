\section{Fission}

Fission~\cite{hid-sp18-521-FissionBlog} is a serverless framework for
Kubernetes. It allows you to create HTTP services on Kubernetes from
functions and can help simplify the learning curve for Kubernetes by
enabling a user to create useful services without knowing much about
Kubernetes itself. Fission works at the source level and abstracts 
away containers from the user. To use it, you create functions using
a variety of languages and then add them with a CLI. You can then 
associate those functions with HTTP routes, Kubernetes events and 
other triggers. Functions are called when their trigger fires and 
they only consume CPU and memory while they are running. Idle function 
consume no resources with the exception of storage. Some of the 
suggested use cases for Fission are creating small REST APIs, 
implementing webhooks, writing chatbots and triggering functions 
based on Kubernetes watches.
