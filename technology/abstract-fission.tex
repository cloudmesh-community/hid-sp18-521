\section{Fission}
Fission~\cite{hid-sp18-521-FissionBlog} is a serverless framework for
Kubernetes. It allows you to create HTTP services on Kubernetes from
functions and can help make Kubernetes easier to work with by
allowing a user to create services without having much knowledge
Kubernetes itself. It can abstract away containers from the user. 
To use it, you create functions using a variety of languages and then
add them with a CLI tool. Functions are called when their trigger fires and 
they only consume CPU and memory while they are running. Idle function 
consume no resources with the exception of storage. Some of the suggested
uses for Fission are chat bots, webhooks, Rest API's and Kubernetes events.
