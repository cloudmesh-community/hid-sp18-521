\section{AWS Greengrass}
AWS Greengrass~\cite{hid-sp18-521-Greengrass} is a product that allows a
developer to create serverless code residing on AWS that can then be run
locally on your devices. Those devices are then able to act locally on the data
it creates while being able to utilize the cloud for handling the infrastructure. 
Devices can still communicate with each other even when unable to connect to the
Internet. Filters can also be added locally to each device allowing the user to be 
able to control what data is being sent back to the cloud. It can help users create
IoT solutions which allow connectivity between many different types of devices
and the cloud simultaneously. Greengrass supports many different programming languages.
