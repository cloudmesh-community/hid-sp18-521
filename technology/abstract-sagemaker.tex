Amazon SageMaker \cite{hid-sp18-521-Sagemaker} was created to allow users 
to quickly and easily build, train and deploy machine learning models. 
To help simplify the building of ML models, Jupyter notebooks are included
which will allow the user to make it easier to explore and visualize 
training data stored in S3. The 12 most common machine learning algorithms
have also come pre-installed and configured, as well as the frameworks 
Tensorflow and MXNet, with the option of also using your own specific 
framework. Using SageMaker to train your models allows you to scale 
underlying infrastructure as needed up to the petabyte scale. Automatic 
tuning of models is also included. Once you are ready for deployment, 
SageMaker allows you to deploy your model onto an auto-scaling cluster 
of EC2 instances spread across multiple availability zones to provide 
fault tolerance and high performance. A/B testing capabilities are built
into the product as well.
