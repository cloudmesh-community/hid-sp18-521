\section{Amazon SageMaker}
Amazon SageMaker~\cite{hid-sp18-521-Sagemaker} was created to help users
be able to develop machine learning models in a more streamlined way. It
includes functionality that allows a user to be able to more quickly build,
train and deploy their models. To help simplify the building of ML models,
Jupyter notebooks are included which will allow the user to make it easier
to explore and visualize training data stored in S3. The 12 most common 
machine learning algorithms have also come pre-installed and configured,
as well as the frameworks Tensorflow and MXNet, with the option of also 
using your own specific framework. Using SageMaker to train your models 
allows you to scale underlying infrastructure as needed up to the petabyte
scale. Automatic tuning of models is also included. SageMaker also takes
advantage of EC2 in order to create highly available and elastic clusters
where you can deploy your model. A/B testing capabilities are built
into the product as well.
